# JISR-GP- Graduation Project

# This project is a graduation project for the Computer Science major. Our goal is to create a platform that connects craftsmen with customers interested in handmade and crafted items. By building this bridge, we aim to support local artisans and enhance the appreciation for crafts within the community.

# Since we are based in Saudi Arabia, This project is in line with the Year of Crafts launched by the Ministry of Culture for 2025. We believe this platform will contribute to promoting local crafts and supporting the cultural identity of the region.

# Additionally, this project supports Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Vision twenty thirty by encouraging local businesses and fostering creativity within the crafts industry.
